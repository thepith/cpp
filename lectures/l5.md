# 5. Vorlesung

* to get the lecture video/slides/etc... use the makefile

#classes

   * see slides in how to uses classes
   * use `_` as a variable prefix in structures to show that the variables belong to a class
   * use `<class-name>::` in defining functions to show that the functions belong to a class
   * when declaring a variable of a class memory is reserved
   * call functions with `<class valiablename>.<function name>`
   * get variables with `<class valiablename>.<variable of cell>`
   * include the header files of the class
   * have class initialized by adding a function with the same name if the class
   * if the constructor has only one argument, then you need to declare the constructor as `explicit`
   * analogous to the constructor there is a desctructor, which cleans up after use of the variable
   * to grant functions access to the private variables, you need to add then a `friendly`
