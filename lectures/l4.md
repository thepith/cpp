## Arrays
* declare arrays with
```cpp
int a[4];
```
which gives you an array with 4 elements, (the first one at `a[0]`). Not that arrays are an address in the memory
* initialize array to zero by:
```cpp
int a[4] = {0};
```
or to other values by
```
int a[4] = {0, 1, 2, 4};
```
## Pointer
* pointer are variables which point to position in the memory (they are an address). Declare with
```cpp
int* p
```
* to get the value of the memory at address `p` use `*p`
* you can also point to a neighboring address with
```
p = a + 1;
```

* to have a string use an array of characters, therefore the following are equivalent:
```
   char* s = "asdf";
   char* s = {'a', 's', 'd', 'f'};
```
* `char**` is an pointer to pointers of type char (see slides)

## Debugging
* to address segmentation faults:
  * use many `printf` commands
  * use `gdb` (GNU Debugger)!:
    * compile with `-g`
    * run `gdb ./<name of executable>`
    * use `make` to call make
    * use `run` to run the program
    * use `bt` to get a backtrace (where error was)
    * use `break <src-file>:<line number>` to set a breakpoint
    * use `print <variable>` to get the current values
    * use `step` to progress to the next line (going into the functions)
    * use `next` to progress to the next line (not proceeding into the functions)
    * use `quit` to exit
    * see slides for more commands
    * does not work well when using optimization

## Make
* use `.PRECIOUS` to define files which should not be deleted by make

## Blatt-04
* note that `ncurses` uses rows and columns, starting at the top left with 1
* rotate by 90 degrees by swapping x and y and making y negative (see slides)
* call refresh at beginning of `initscreen` when the first call of `getch` clears the screen
